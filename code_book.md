## Input data

The data set comprises of mean and standard deviation variables averaged per
training subject of the [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).
The input data used was the computed features of the input dataset. It does
not contain any missing values.

## Processing

Source data contains 561 variables, of which 79 variables dealing with mean and
standard deviation have been retained.  These variables have been averaged per subject
to produce the output data.

## Output data

Each row in the output data corresponds to an individual, identified by the
'subj' column. The remaining columns contain the averaged measurements.

Below is a list of the columns in the output. For details of the variables,
refer to the code book of the input data set.
